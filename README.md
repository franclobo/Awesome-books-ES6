# Awesome-books-ES6

Based on the construction of my first porject with JavaScript objects for Microverse Curriculum Awesome books, I will organize the files in modules.

## Built With

- Visual Studio COde and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

In this project, I will restructure my Awesome books app code. The goal is to make it more organized by using modules. I will also practice the ES6 syntax that I have learned.
